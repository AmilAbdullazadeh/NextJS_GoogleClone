## Getting Started

Create a directory or a folder

```

Go to the project directory

  cd project
```

Install dependencies

  # or
  yarn
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/\*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
